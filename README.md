# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Project
According to machine learning models, would Jack have survived the Titanic regardless of the door controversy ?

Introduction

In this project, I aimed at determining if Jack would have survived the Titanic with or without the infamous door. As we all know, Jack from the movie Titanic
died a cold death after the titanic sinked and he sacrificed himself for the other protagonist, Rose, by letting her use the door, thereby preventing her 
from freezing to death. The size of the door has been the subject of numerous debates ; Was the door really that small ? Was it actually big enough for 
the two of them ? Did Rose actually let her lover die a gruesome death ? But one of the most important question of them all remains : would Jack have 
died anyways ? This is the question we will be answering through this mini project thanks to the power of AI.
